# Ready-for-School-A-point-and-click-game

This is a 3D game, built on Unity, with an objective of completing a sequence of simple tasks. 
The scene is set inside of a child's bedroom who has to get ready for school. Using the left and right mouse controls, the player can explore the room. 
Various objects around the room are interactable but will only be active following a certain sequence. 
The instructions for following the sequence are also provided in the scene (which the player has to look around for).
